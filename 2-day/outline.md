Phylogenetic biogeography
is a branch of historical biogeography
with the aim of inferring the evolution
of the geographical range of a group of species
using its phylogenetic relationships
(Brundin 1966 *K. Svenska Vetensk Akad. Handl.* **11**:1-472).
This workshop
will introduce the theory and practice of phylogenetic biogeography,
using the explicit geographic ranges
of the terminals in the phylogeny
as well as high-resolution dynamic paleogeography models
(Arias 2023 url: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.16.567427>),
as implemented in the computer program **`PhyGeo`**
(available at:
<https://github.com/js-arias/phygeo>).

The main objective of the workshop
is to allow participants to understand
the advantages and disadvantages of using models
based on explicit geographic data
for phylogenetic biogeography research.
For the practical part,
participants will be able to:

- Build their own `PhyGeo` data sets.
- Analyze such data sets with `PhyGeo`.
- Understand the results of a `PhyGeo` analysis.

## Requirements

The workshop is aimed at students
and researchers
working in biogeography and biodiversity.
It is expected that the participants have some training in phylogenetics,
as the workshop will not cover the building
and evaluation of phylogenetic trees.

It is expected that each participant has their own laptop computer.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data sets.
Programs and sample data sets
will be available at the time of the workshop
(most of them are open-source programs).
